# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
In this project I extracted data from an SQL database. I cleaned, transformed and analyzed the data. I loaded the data into a database and I developed and implemented a QA process to validate transformed data agains raw data. 

### Goals
1. Complete the project to the best of my abilities.
2. Ask for assistance when necessary.
3. Learn new tips and tricks for working with SQL.

## Process
### 1. Downloaded data files
### 2. Made my own copy of the github repository - SQL-Project
### 3. Created tables in pgAdmin
### 4. Extracted data from the CSV files and loaded it into the tables
### 5. Cleaned the data 
### 6. Completed the starting_with_questions questions
### 7. Completed the starting_with_data questions
### 8. Developed and executed a QA process
### 9. 

## Results
I discovered that the given data is for an ecommerce site of some kind. The ecommerce database I created has five tables called analytics_clean3, products_clean, salesbysku_clean, salesreport_clean, and sessions_clean2. I learned that the data cleaning process is quite time-consuming and a bit frustrating (for a first-timer at least). While cleaning the data I realised just how important it is to ensure accurate data typing; but while working through starting_with_questions.md, I also realised that even though I tried to be very careful with my data types I still didn't get them all right the first time around. When working through starting_with_questions.md, I honestly felt pretty overwhelmed. I'm super curious to find out if my solutions are correct, I felt that they were all too simple? That maybe I misunderstood the questions?
I discovered that this data could tell me:
- the cities which have the highest levels of transaction revenue on a site.
- the average number of products ordered by site visitors in a city/country.
- that there is a pattern between the city/country and the product category ordered.
- the top selling product from each city/country and the patterns within the resulting dataset.
- the summarized impact of revenue generated from each city/country.
- the rank of visitors to the site based on their time spent on the site.
- the top three revenue generating products.
- what products fit into a specified classification.
- the product with the highest revenue (and said total revenue).

## Challenges 
### 1. Loading the data - getting the data types right took a couple of tries for the first table.
### 2. Solving the loading issues was difficult when trying to use pgAdmin4's tools, writing the necessary code myself was easier and seemed to work better.
### 3. When cleaning the data, I found myself rather overwhelmed and unsure of where to start. I did manage to get into a comfortable groove but now that I've finished the cleaning I can't help but worry about details I might have missed.
### 4. For the analytics table, I could not identify a suitable primary key, this had me stumped for a while as I thought that tables required primary keys.
### 5. I had difficulty with the starting_with_questions. I'm not fully confident that my queries work as I intended. I'm not sure if this is a confidence issue or if I really am confused.
### 6.
